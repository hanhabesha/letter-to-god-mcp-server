# Letter to God MCP Server

A Universal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides personalized Bible guidance and mentorship. Works with **any MCP client** (Cline, Claude Desktop, etc.) without requiring API keys, or can run standalone with OpenAI integration.

## üåü Key Features

- **Universal MCP Compatibility**: Works with any MCP client (Cline, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- **No API Key Required**: Uses your MCP client's LLM - no separate OpenAI key needed
- **Dual Mode Support**: MCP mode (prompt generation) + Standalone mode (direct OpenAI)
- **Personalized Bible Guidance**: Get customized spiritual guidance based on your situation
- **Three Scripture Selection**: Finds three relevant Bible scriptures for your situation
- **Personalized Letter from God**: Receive a full-length letter written as if from God Almighty
- **Biblical Stories & Parables**: Includes relevant stories and explanations for each scripture
- **Actionable Advice**: Provides practical activities and actions to help cope and overcome problems
- **Beautiful Terminal Output**: Colored, formatted responses for easy reading

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: MCP Mode (Recommended - No API Key Needed)

**Works with any MCP client using their configured LLM:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start MCP server (default mode)
npm start
```

### Option 2: Standalone Mode (Requires OpenAI API Key)

```bash
# Install dependencies (including OpenAI)
npm install

# Set up environment
npm run setup

# Edit .env file with your OpenAI API key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Start in standalone mode
npm run start:standalone
```

### Option 3: Command Line Interface

```bash
# Direct CLI usage (requires OpenAI API key)
node cli.js --name "John" --feeling "anxious about my future"
node cli.js --name "Sarah" --feeling "struggling with forgiveness"
node cli.js -n "David" -f "feeling lost and confused"

# See all options
node cli.js --help
```

## üîß How It Works

### MCP Mode (Default)
- **No API keys required**
- Generates structured prompts for your MCP client's LLM
- Works with Cline, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible client
- Uses whatever LLM your client is configured with

### Standalone Mode
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Directly calls OpenAI's GPT-4
- Independent of any MCP client

## üìã Usage

The server provides one main tool:

### `getBibleGuidance`

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string, required): Your name
- `feeling` (string, required): What you are feeling today or the problem you're facing

**Example Usage in MCP Client:**
```
Use the getBibleGuidance tool with:
- name: "John"
- feeling: "anxious about my future and feeling lost"
```

**Response:**
The tool will provide a structured prompt that asks the LLM to act as God Almighty and provide:
- Three relevant Bible scriptures
- A personalized letter with explanations
- Biblical stories and parables
- Practical actions and activities
- All formatted as a direct message from God

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Tool shows empty input schema"**:
   - Restart your MCP client after server changes
   - Verify the server path is correct in your MCP client config
   - Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

2. **"Parameters showing as undefined"**:
   - This was the original issue - now fixed!
   - The server now properly validates and extracts parameters
   - Make sure you're using the updated version

3. **"Server not connecting"**:
   - Verify the path to `index.js` is correct in your MCP client config
   - Check that Node.js is installed and accessible
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

4. **"No response from OpenAI"** (Standalone mode only):
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
   - Check OpenAI service status

### Debug Mode

Run the server with debug output:
```bash
DEBUG=* node index.js
```

### Testing Connection

Use the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
npm test
```
